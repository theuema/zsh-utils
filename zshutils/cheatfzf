# --------------------------------- _Pipe to Fzf_ alias
alias -g Z='| fzf'                  Usage e.g.: 'npm search react Z'

# --------------------------------- Fzf
vim \$(fzf)                         Use the output of fzf as an argument for another command
                                    fzf can read a list from STDIN, process it, and write the selected items to STDOUT, things become more interesting when fzf is run in conjunction with other commands.

echo $ PATH | tr ':' '\n' | fzf     show PATH folders
npm search react | fzf              npm search

# --------------------------------- Search syntax
                                    Fzf supports special tokens that change the way search terms are processed [Search syntax]
'wild:                              Exact match, return items that include wild [Search syntax]
^music:                             Prefix-exact-match, return items that start with music [Search syntax]
.mp3$:                              Suffix-exact-match, return items that end with .mp3 [Search syntax]
!fire:                              Inverse-exact-match, return items that do not include fire [Search syntax]
!^music:                            Inverse-prefix-exact-match, return items that do not start with music [Search syntax]
!.mp3$:                             Inverse-suffix-exact-match, return items that do not end with .mp3 [Search syntax]
                                    Note that SPACE acts as an AND operator and | as an OR [Search syntax]
